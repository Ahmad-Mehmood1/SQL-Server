# Data Analysis with SQL Server(Heart Attack Risk)

In utilizing SQL Server for data analysis on a dataset pertaining to heart rate risk, a comprehensive examination of the dataset was conducted to extract valuable insights and patterns related to heart rate and associated risks. SQL queries were employed to aggregate and summarize heart rate data, calculate averages, standard deviations, and other relevant statistical metrics. Additionally, filtering and grouping functions in SQL were used to categorize heart rate data based on predefined risk levels, facilitating a thorough analysis of how heart rate correlates with varying risk factors. This approach allowed for a deeper understanding of the dataset, enabling the identification of potential correlations between heart rate, risk factors, and the overall assessment of cardiovascular health. The insights gained from this analysis can be instrumental in formulating strategies for risk mitigation, personalized healthcare plans, or research initiatives focused on improving heart health.

The SQL server has been used to answer some insightful question. These Question are as follows:

### 1. Can you provide an overview of the age distribution within the dataset? How does age correlate with heart attack risk?

``````sql
select
age, count(*) as count_per_age
from heart_attack_risk
where [Heart Attack Risk] = 1
group by Age
order by Age
--group wise heart attack risk
select
[Age Group], count(*) as count_per_age
from heart_attack_risk
where [Heart Attack Risk] = 1
group by [Age Group]
order by [Age Group]
``````

The first SQL query counts the occurrences of individuals with a heart attack risk (Heart Attack Risk = 1) based on their age, providing a count for each age group. The second query does a similar count but groups the data by age groups, summarizing the heart attack risk occurrences in each age group. These queries aim to analyze heart attack risk distribution in the dataset by age and age groups, facilitating a better understanding of risk patterns and potential interventions.

### 2.What is the gender distribution among the patients, and how does gender influence heart attack risk?

This SQL query counts and summarizes the occurrences of heart attack risk (where Heart Attack Risk = 1) based on gender (Sex), providing a count for each gender. It helps analyze how heart attack risk is distributed among different genders in the dataset.

``````sql
select 
Sex,
count(*) as CountPerGender
from heart_attack_risk
where [Heart Attack Risk] = 1
group by 
Sex
``````
Sex | CountPerGender
|---| ------|
Male | 2195
Female | 944

### 3.Could you explain the relationship between cholesterol levels and heart attack risk? Are there specific thresholds that indicate higher risk?

> Average cholesterol level for patients

``````sql
select 
avg(case when [Heart Attack Risk] = 1 then Cholesterol end) as AvgCholesterol_HighRisk,
  AVG(CASE WHEN [Heart Attack Risk] = 0 THEN [Cholesterol] END) AS AvgCholesterol_LowRisk
from heart_attack_risk
``````

This SQL query calculates the average cholesterol levels for individuals categorized into high risk (Heart Attack Risk = 1) and low risk (Heart Attack Risk = 0) groups. It provides insights into the average cholesterol levels for each risk category, aiding in understanding the potential correlation between cholesterol levels and heart attack risk.

AvgCholesterol_HighRisk | AvgCholesterol_LowRisk
------------------------|-----------------------
261.970372730169 | 258.708926031294

> Identify specific cholesterol thresholds that indicate higher heart attack risk.

``````sql
select 
[Heart Attack Risk],
avg(Cholesterol) as avg_cholesterol
from heart_attack_risk
group by [Heart Attack Risk]
``````

This SQL code is retrieving information from a table named "heart_attack_risk." It calculates the average cholesterol levels for individuals based on their heart attack risk, categorizing the data into two groups: heart attack risk of 0 and heart attack risk of 1. The AVG function computes the average cholesterol for each group. The GROUP BY clause groups the data based on the heart attack risk, allowing for separate calculations for each risk category. The resulting output shows the heart attack risk (0 or 1) and the corresponding average cholesterol level for each risk category.

Heart Attack Risk | avg_cholesterol
------------------|----------------
0 | 258.708926031294
1 | 261.970372730169

### 4. How does blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) correlate with the risk of heart attack?

This SQL code is querying a table named "heart_attack_risk." It calculates the average systolic blood pressure (avgSystolicBP) and average diastolic blood pressure (avgDiastolicBP) for individuals based on their heart attack risk, categorizing the data into two groups: heart attack risk of 0 and heart attack risk of 1. The AVG function is used to compute the averages for each blood pressure measure within each risk group. The GROUP BY clause organizes the data by heart attack risk, facilitating separate calculations for each risk category. The resulting output displays the heart attack risk (0 or 1) and the corresponding average systolic and diastolic blood pressure for each risk category. This information helps analyze the relationship between blood pressure and heart attack risk.

``````sql
select 
[Heart Attack Risk],
avg([Systolic BP]) as avgSystolicBP,
avg([Diastolic BP] ) as avgDiastolicBP
from 
heart_attack_risk
group by [Heart Attack Risk]
``````

Heart Attack Risk | avgSystolicBP | avgDiastolicBP

1 | 135.731124561962 | 85.0086014654349

### 5. Are there any notable patterns or correlations between heart rate and the risk of a heart attack?

``````sql
select 
[Heart Attack Risk],
avg([Heart Rate]) as avg_heartrate
from heart_attack_risk
group by [Heart Attack Risk]
``````

In this SQL query, we're examining data from a table called "heart_attack_risk." We want to analyze the average heart rate for individuals in two distinct groups based on heart attack risk: those with a heart attack risk of 0 (low risk) and those with a heart attack risk of 1 (high risk).

We're using the AVG function to calculate the average heart rate for each risk group. The AVG function takes the heart rate data and calculates the mean value for heart rate within each risk category.

The GROUP BY clause is crucial here because it allows us to aggregate the data and group it based on heart attack risk. This means we'll get separate average heart rate values for the low-risk and high-risk groups.

The resulting output will display two rows: one for the low-risk group (heart attack risk = 0) and one for the high-risk group (heart attack risk = 1), each showing the corresponding average heart rate for that particular risk category. This information provides valuable insights into potential correlations between heart rate and heart attack risk.
